# Graduate Career Recommendation System 
A project to enhance job readiness by matching graduate skills with job market demands.
## ðŸ“„ Project Description

The Graduate Career Recommendation System is a data-driven solution aimed at helping students identify the most suitable job roles based on their current skill sets and preferences.

This system analyzes:
- Technical and soft skills provided by the student
- Preferred job role and location
- Work experience (if available)
- Existing skill gaps compared to the target roles

Based on this analysis, the system:
- Recommends job roles that best match the studentâ€™s profile
- Highlights missing or weak skills for those roles
- Provides guidance to improve job readiness and align with market demands

The goal is to empower students with personalized insights that can help them transition smoothly from education to employment.
